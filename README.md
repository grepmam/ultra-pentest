A tool to perform a quick security test on your website through the ZAP API.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/grepmam/ultra-pentest.git
```

***Note**: only supports 3.11 or higher.*

## How to use it?

We configure the environment variables and the attack file:

```bash
ZAP_EXECUTABLE=<exec-path>
```

***Note**: The executable path may vary. On Kali Linux it is located in /usr/share/zaproxy/zap.sh*


```bash
vim default.json
```

We start ZAP Daemon:

```bash
ultra-pentest start
```

Launch quick attack:

```bash
ultra-pentest quick-attack --config-file default.json http://example.com/
```

Launch attack as a logged in user:

```bash
ultra-pentest run-attack --config-file default.json http://example.com/
```

Once finished you can generate the report:

```bash
ultra-pentest reports generate "Test" traditional-html -o /tmp/test
```
